JFD-Games

This project is currently planned to be a simple, decision-based visual novel-style rpg with multiple endings. At the time of writing, the project is accepting any and all concept ideas to be discussed.  The game is not to be mechanically-dependant and is story driven. 

If anyone is interested in helping in the programming of the game, read up on the basics of Java here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/

	Once you are comfortable enough from everything to input/output, classes, and arrays, etcs, read up on 2d graphics here:
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/

	I recommend trying out some stuff with a simple IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like JCreator:
